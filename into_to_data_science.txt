1) How can we maintain tractable data structures for use with phylogenetic projects?

"I just wasted five hours running an analysis on the wrong input file."

"I can't remember where I saved my output."

"I accidentally overwrote my raw data."

Many of us have probably said one or more of the above sentences. When you're balancing 
multiple projects and lots of data, 
One of the biggest challenges to any project is placing project files in a structure that is 
easy for you, the scientist, to access and maintain. 

This chapter will cover the basics of project organization and data organization and management. 
At the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with:

1. How to store project input files and project outputs
2. How to organize your data in a way that is reusable for you, and for others
3. How to automate many data management and sorting functions that are usually performed 
in a spreadsheet program

Following this chapter, there is a short practicum where we will use what we've learned to 
subsample taxonomic data for use in a later phylogenetic analysis.

     General data 'best practices': flat files, variables as columns and occurrences as rows, data as read only
    Pandas for parsing data
    Grouping data by taxonomic level
    Choosing a subset of data to include - at random, and with clade-structured subsampling
    Writing out the relevant info about what taxa were subsampled

2) Reading character data

    Subsampling character data according to part (1)
    Managing the namespaces
    Using pack to ensure that all data are represented in both datasets (important in BEAST, will shortly be unimportant in RevBayes)
    Writing out the data

3) Processing the output

    Pruning non-data tips from a tree (ie occurrance time taxa)
    Summarizing
    Some sort of short capstone, such as showing how to extract the width of the HPD to demonstrate something about sampling or something.
